# Deep Learning Application Labs â€“ MLPs, Residuals, Transfer Learning, NLP & Adversarial Learning

This repository collects a series of labs exploring modern deep learning techniques across computer vision, natural language processing, and robustness.
Each lab builds on the previous one, starting from fundamental architectures (MLPs, CNNs) and progressing to transfer learning, transformers, and adversarial robustness.

##  Repository Structure

- `lab1/` : MLPs, Residual Networks, and Transfer Learning

- `lab3/` : Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT

- `lab4/` : Adversarial Learning & OOD Detection

## Installation

Before running any lab, install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
